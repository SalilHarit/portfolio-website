       Hi, I am Salil Harit i'm a mechatronics engineer and an aspiring full stack webdeveloper 
       my interest in computers began way back in 2013 when i used play video games and was fascinated 
       by the visuals and controls of games even as a kid i explored code world i wrote simple programs and understood syntaxes and how computers worked as well as little experiments like installing linux distros on old phones and removing viruses from computers also i'd like to pursue my dream to be an engineer while exploring the industry each passing day i learn more and more about the 
       the promising growth of the tech industry and i'd like to join a team or company that has the same values,i've read and heard about growth of technology in the past 50 years and i thought 
       to myself how amazing must be the people of the industry must be to be able to come up with something so robust and exponentially faster each year this industry has stood the test of time
       and also supported humanity multiple times including pandemic and i hope to be a contributor to its greatness as much as i can.
